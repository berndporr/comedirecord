What is it?
-----------
comedirecord is a simple program to record data from a
comedi device and write the data to a file. Its
philosophy is not to alter the data which is written
to the hard drive but allowing flexible monitoring
of the data, for example during an experiment. Data
is always saved at the maximum sampling rate (default
1kHz but can be changed with the "-r" parameter) 
and unfiltered in a MATLAB/OCTAVE friendly format.

It has been designed for the USB-DUX board but it
should also run with other daq boards. The number of channels
is set to the maximum number possible
but can be changed by the commandline parameter -c to
increase the overall sampling rate.

A IIR notch filter has been implemented to filter out
unwanted hum from the mains. This might be useful for 
medical applications. Default is 50Hz but can be changed
via command line parameter -n.

The data is written out as an ASCII file and is always
unfiltered and at the max internal sampling rate.

Additional data from another program can be appended to the
data file via a socket connection. comedirecord acts as the 
server and the other application is its client. The port number
can be specified with the -p option and then comedirecord
waits until a client connects to it. You can test it
with: "comedirecord -p 65000" and then
"telnet localhost 65000".

The data can be imported into GNUPLOT, scilab or octave. 
The first column is the sample number or time in secs. 
The next columns represent the (raw/phys) data 
from the comedi device.

What is needed?
---------------
1) An up to date version of comedi and comedilib (which ships with ubuntu).
See http://www.comedi.org or http://www.linux-usb-daq.co.uk.
2) The QT5 library (shipped with many distros).
3) IIR filter library available from https://github.com/berndporr/iir1

How to compile?
---------------
qmake
make
sudo cp comedirecord /usr/local/bin

A quick guide how to import the data into octave (MATLAB clone):

1) load myname5.dat
2) ecg=myname5(:,2);
This loads the second column of the data set. The first one
contains the time. Thus, in case you need the time:
3) t=myname5(:,1);

.SH NAME
comedirecord \- an oscilloscope for COMEDI
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B comedirecord
[\fIOPTION\fR]... FILENAME
.SH DESCRIPTION
A simple oscilloscope application which displays data from COMEDI
DAQ cards. It can run with multiple idential cards and save the data
in a single text file which then can be imported into OCTAVE, scilab,
gnuplot, MATLAB and other data ploting applications.
A 50Hz notch filter and a DC filter can be
used to improve the data being displayed. However
the data is always saved unfiltered in its original form
and at the sampling rate specified with
the -r option. Comedirecord can
also listen on a TCP port which allows the logging of additional
information from external programs or just logging comments
connected to telnet.
.TP
\-f FORMAT
set data format for ASCII files: 0 = space separated, 1 = csv
.TP
\-c CHANNELS
sets the number of channels
.TP
\-m CHANNEL_ROWS
sets the number of channels per row on screen. This can be used
to create more space for the actual plot.
.TP
\-n FREQUENCY
sets the notch filter frequency to remove unwanted mains interference.
.TP
\-d DEVICES
sets the maximum number of comedi devices (default is that all
connected COMEDI devices are used)
.TP
\-l LOWEST_COMEDI_DEV_NUM
sets lowest comedi device number which will be
probed (default is 0 which means that /dev/comedi0 will be probed first).
.TP
\-r SAMPLINGRATE
sets both the internal sampling rate and the sampling
rate for the data files. If a slower timebase is selected
then the displayed data is averaged. The saved data has always
the sampling rate specified here.
.TP
\-p PORT
sets the TCP port for receiving external data, for example via telnet.
This data will be appended in the data files after the last channel sample.
.TP
\-t TEXT_APPENDED
default text appended when external data via TCP hasn't been received
or when external data has a lower sampling rate than the comedirecord.
This is useful for gnuplot or octave so that the number of columns
is constant.
